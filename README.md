## Getting started

Choose the instructions for this project's stack.

1. Install Python 3.10 or newer.
2. Create and activate a virtual environment:
   ```bash
   python -m venv .venv
   # Windows: .venv\Scripts\activate
   # macOS/Linux: source .venv/bin/activate
   ```
3. Install and run:

   pip install -r requirements.txt
   python app.py
   ```
4. Open the local URL printed in the terminal (usually http://127.0.0.1:5000).

## Project structure

The source files are kept in the root directory or in `public/`, `templates/`, or the conventional language-specific folders. Generated local databases, secrets, and dependency folders are excluded with `.gitignore` where applicable.

## Notes
- These are intermediate-level starter repositories intended for learning and customization. Review, test, and personalize them before presenting them as your own work.
- Never commit API keys, passwords, tokens, or private user data.
- Some projects use external APIs and therefore require an internet connection.
